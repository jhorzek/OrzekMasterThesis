\usage{
simARCL_scaled_10(sampleSize, autoEffect, crossEffect)
}
\description{
simARCL_scaled_10 creates an ARCL(1)-SEM model with OpenMx with 5 latent variables and 1 manifest per latent and time point for data simulation. It returns the simulated data set and a covariance based and a raw data based model. 10 Timepoints are created of which the initial five are omitted (burned)
The model has 10% non-zero cross-lagged effects
